This project find which factors affect airline passenger satisfaction the most. By doing feature engineering and feature selection which is clean, complete and explore the dataset, we get some insight which was used to build the machine learning model that can predict passenger satisfaction of the customer using only survey question data. I applied five models and tuned hyper parameter to improve the model performances and selected the best one.
